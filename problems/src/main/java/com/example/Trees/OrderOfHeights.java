You are given the following :

A positive number N
Heights : A list of heights of N persons standing in a queue
Infronts : A list of numbers corresponding to each person (P) that gives the number of persons who are taller than P
and standing in front of P
You need to return list of actual order of personsâ€™s height

Consider that heights will be unique

Example

Input :
Heights: 5 3 2 6 1 4
InFronts: 0 1 2 0 3 2
Output :
actual order is: 5 3 2 1 6 4
So, you can see that for the person with height 5, there is no one taller than him who is in front of him,
and hence Infronts has 0 for him.

For person with height 3, there is 1 person ( Height : 5 ) in front of him who is taller than him.

You can do similar inference for other people in the list.
